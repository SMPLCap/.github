## Welcome to Motrix
![GitHub User's stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MotrixLab)


At Motrix, we are dedicated to advancing the capture and generation of expressive human motion in 3D, with parametric human body models as a unified representation. We study the full lifecycle of human motion: from large-scale motion datasets and robust pose and shape estimation across diverse visual inputs, to controllable, physically plausible motion synthesis.

By bridging motion data, capture, and generation through shared representations and foundation models, Motrix aims to advance scalable, world-grounded human motion capture and generation across vision, graphics, and embodied AI.
