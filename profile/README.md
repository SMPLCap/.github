## Welcome to SMPLCap
![GitHub User's stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/SMPLCap)

At SMPLCap, we focus on advancing the field of 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation (HPS). Our goal is to accurately capture detailed full-body human motionâ€”including hands and facial expressionsâ€”from various input sources, using parametric human body models such as SMPL and SMPL-X as our standard output representation.

We develop methods and tools to recover full-body pose and shape from diverse input modalities. Our research focuses on EHPS foundation models and benchmarks, robust estimation in perspective-distorted images, world-grounded applications, and one-stage pipelines with integrated localization.
